# AmberFerret
Yet another attempt at a game engine

##Goals
This will be built in a incremental approach and hopefully run to complete in a reasonable state.  Inspirations from Game Coding Complete will be the core ideas behind it, but before it becomes too monolithic to find problems, individual components will be separated enough to be tested individually.

##Things to Decide On
Should the core of this be in c++ or c#?  Some of the tools will be in c#, but to work with GLUF, it would be ideal to work in c++ (openGL and a lot of other libraries are c++ native so that would be good).  Idealy I would port GLUF to c#, but that is a lot of work.
